<h1>Model H - Variants</h1>

<p>
The Model H comes in two variants, each meant to fit different versions of the Model M keyboard.
The difference between these is the number of flexible connectors and the number of pins on each.

<p>
Please open your keyboard to make sure the connectors you order match what's inside your keyboard.

<h2> 16 + 8 + 4</h3>

<p>
16 columns + 8 rows + 4 LEDs

<p>
These connectors were used for all keyboards before 1991, and some in the early 90s.

<p>
This should also work for keyboards without LEDs (assuming they use the 16+8 connectors).

<h2> 16 + 12</h3>

<p>
16 columns + 12 rows and LEDs combined

<p>
This connector configuration was introduced in 1991 and was used for most (but not all) keyboards after that.
